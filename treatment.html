  <h1>Treatment Options</h1>
  <p>We offer a wide range of personalized treatments for sleep-disordered breathing.</p>
</section>
<main class="container">
<section>
<h2>CPAP / BiPAP</h2>
<p>These are the most common and effective treatments for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. A small machine delivers air through a mask, keeping the airway open during sleep. BiPAP provides different pressures for inhaling and exhaling. CPAP requires a prescription and a proper mask fit. While very effective, comfort and compliance are key to success.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Oral Appliances</h2>
<p>These are custom-made dental devices worn during sleep. They gently reposition the lower jaw forward, opening the airway. Ideal for mild to moderate OSA or those intolerant to CPAP. At Capital ENT, we work with an airway-focused dentist in our Austin office and refer to additional trusted providers when needed.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Inspire Therapy</h2>
<p>A small device is implanted under the skin to stimulate airway muscles during sleep. It’s activated by a remote and works with your natural breathing. Inspire is best for patients with moderate to severe OSA who cannot tolerate CPAP and meet specific eligibility criteria, including BMI and airway anatomy.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Nasal & Sinus Surgery</h2>
<p>Surgery may be recommended to address nasal obstruction and improve breathing. This includes procedures like septoplasty, turbinate reduction, balloon sinuplasty, and endoscopic sinus surgery. Better nasal airflow can reduce snoring and improve CPAP tolerance.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Weight Management</h2>
<p>Excess weight is a key contributor to airway narrowing. We offer support with an in-house dietician, behavior coaching, and medical therapy, including medications like Zepbound. Even modest weight loss can significantly reduce the severity of sleep apnea.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Allergy & Sinus Care</h2>
<p>Chronic nasal congestion and allergies worsen sleep-disordered breathing. We offer allergy testing, immunotherapy, and treatments for sinus inflammation to help restore nasal breathing and improve comfort with CPAP or oral appliance use.</p>
