    <h2>CPAP Therapy</h2>
    <img src="cpap-illustration.png" alt="CPAP therapy illustration" class="treatment-image" />
    <p>Pressurized airflow therapy delivered through a mask to keep your airway open during sleep. This is the first-line treatment for moderate to severe OSA. When tolerated, CPAP is highly effective in restoring restful sleep, improving oxygen levels, and reducing cardiovascular risk.</p>
    <div class="details-box">
      <strong>Best for:</strong> Patients with moderate to severe OSA without major anatomical obstruction.<br>
      <strong>Pros:</strong> Most effective treatment option; immediate results; non-invasive.<br>
      <strong>Cons:</strong> Can be uncomfortable; requires nightly use; machine maintenance and travel considerations.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="treatment-section">
    <h2>Oral Appliances</h2>
    <img src="oral-placeholder.png" alt="Oral appliance placeholder" class="treatment-image" />
    <p>These custom-fit dental devices gently reposition your lower jaw or tongue to prevent the airway from collapsing during sleep. Oral appliances are ideal for patients with mild to moderate OSA or those who find CPAP uncomfortable or difficult to tolerate.</p>
    <div class="details-box">
      <strong>Best for:</strong> Mild to moderate OSA, especially in patients who cannot tolerate CPAP.<br>
      <strong>Pros:</strong> Compact, easy to travel with, well-tolerated by many patients.<br>
      <strong>Cons:</strong> Less effective for severe OSA; may cause jaw discomfort or dental changes over time.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="treatment-section">
    <h2>Inspire Therapy</h2>
    <img src="inspire-placeholder.png" alt="Inspire placeholder" class="treatment-image" />
    <p>Inspire is an implantable device that stimulates key airway muscles while you sleep, preventing airway collapse. It’s best suited for patients with moderate to severe OSA who cannot tolerate CPAP and meet specific anatomical and diagnostic criteria.</p>
    <div class="details-box">
      <strong>Best for:</strong> Moderate to severe OSA with CPAP intolerance and favorable airway anatomy.<br>
      <strong>Pros:</strong> No mask or hose; long-term relief with consistent results.<br>
      <strong>Cons:</strong> Surgical procedure required; requires evaluation and follow-up programming; not for all OSA types.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="treatment-section">
    <h2>Nasal & Sinus Surgery</h2>
    <p>Surgical options such as septoplasty, turbinate reduction, or balloon sinuplasty can improve nasal airflow. These procedures are often used in combination with other treatments to optimize airway patency and breathing comfort.</p>
    <div class="details-box">
      <strong>Best for:</strong> Patients with nasal obstruction contributing to poor CPAP tolerance or nighttime breathing.<br>
      <strong>Pros:</strong> Structural correction; can improve success of other treatments.<br>
      <strong>Cons:</strong> Recovery time; risk of bleeding or recurrence depending on anatomy.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="treatment-section">
    <h2>Weight Management</h2>
    <p>Weight loss can significantly improve or resolve OSA in some patients. We offer support through our licensed dietitian and medical therapy options, including medications like Zepbound when appropriate.</p>
    <div class="details-box">
      <strong>Best for:</strong> Patients with elevated BMI contributing to airway collapse.<br>
      <strong>Pros:</strong> Addresses root cause; benefits extend beyond sleep; can reduce need for other therapies.<br>
      <strong>Cons:</strong> Gradual improvement; requires long-term lifestyle commitment.
