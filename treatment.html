  <h2>Tailored Treatments for Better Sleep</h2>
  <p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution. We offer a range of personalized treatment options to address your unique needs and goals.</p>

  <h2>CPAP / BiPAP</h2>
  <p>Pressurized airflow therapy to keep your airway open during sleep. Considered first-line treatment for moderate to severe OSA.</p>

  <h2>Oral Appliances</h2>
  <p>Custom-fitted dental devices worn at night to gently reposition your jaw and improve airflow. Great for mild to moderate OSA or CPAP-intolerant patients.</p>

  <h2>Nasal & Sinus Surgery</h2>
  <p>Procedures like septoplasty, turbinate reduction, or balloon sinuplasty improve airflow through the nose, often improving CPAP tolerance and sleep quality.</p>

  <h2>Inspire Therapy</h2>
  <p>Implanted device that stimulates the airway to prevent collapse. For select patients with moderate to severe OSA who cannot tolerate CPAP.</p>

  <h2>Weight Management</h2>
  <p>We offer support through our in-house dietician and may recommend medications like Zepbound for eligible patients to support airway improvement through weight loss.</p>

  <h2>Allergy & Sinus Care</h2>
  <p>Comprehensive allergy testing and treatment, including immunotherapy, to reduce nasal inflammation and congestion that can worsen SDB.</p>
