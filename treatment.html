    <h2 id="cpap">CPAP Therapy</h2>
    <img src="cpap-illustration.png" alt="CPAP Therapy Illustration" class="treatment-image" />
    <p>CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) therapy is the first-line treatment for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. It uses a machine to deliver a steady stream of air through a mask worn during sleep, keeping your airway open. Modern CPAP machines are quiet, adjustable, and can track your sleep data to help improve effectiveness over time.</p>

    <h2 id="oral">Oral Appliances</h2>
    <img src="placeholder.png" alt="Oral Appliance Placeholder" class="treatment-image" />
    <p>Custom-made dental appliances reposition the lower jaw or tongue to help keep the airway open during sleep. These devices are ideal for patients with mild to moderate OSA or for those who cannot tolerate CPAP therapy. Oral appliances are compact, easy to travel with, and do not require power.</p>

    <h2 id="inspire">Inspire Therapy</h2>
    <img src="placeholder.png" alt="Inspire Therapy Placeholder" class="treatment-image" />
    <p>Inspire is an implantable device that stimulates the airway muscles during sleep to prevent collapse. The device is placed under the skin during a same-day outpatient procedure and is controlled using a remote. Inspire is FDA-approved and works inside your body, activated when you sleep and turned off when you wake.</p>

  <section class="treatment-section">
    <h2 id="nasal">Nasal & Sinus Surgery</h2>
    <img src="placeholder.png" alt="Nasal Surgery Placeholder" class="treatment-image" />
    <p>For patients with anatomical issues like a deviated septum or turbinate hypertrophy, nasal and sinus surgery can significantly improve airflow and sleep quality. These procedures include septoplasty, turbinate reduction, and balloon sinuplasty, often performed under local anesthesia with minimal downtime.</p>

  <section class="treatment-section">
    <h2 id="weight">Weight Management</h2>
    <img src="placeholder.png" alt="Weight Management Placeholder" class="treatment-image" />
    <p>Excess weight is a major risk factor for sleep-disordered breathing. We offer in-house support through registered dietitians, nutrition counseling, and medication-assisted options like GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., Zepbound). A modest weight loss can reduce the severity of OSA or even resolve it entirely in some patients.</p>
