    <h1>Melatonin as a Sleep Aid</h1>
    <p>Understanding how melatonin works and whether it's right for you.</p>
  </section>

<p>Melatonin is a natural hormone produced by your brain in response to darkness. It helps regulate your sleep-wake cycle and signals to your body that it’s time to rest. Because of this role, melatonin supplements are commonly used to help people fall asleep more easily.</p>
<div class="floating-box">
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Triggers sleep:</strong> Helps shift your internal clock, especially helpful for jet lag or shift work.</li>
<li><strong>Does not sedate:</strong> Melatonin is not a sedative — it signals your body to start winding down rather than forcing sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Best taken 30–60 minutes before bed:</strong> Timing is important for effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="floating-box">
<h3>Things to Know</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lower doses (0.3–1 mg) may be just as effective as higher ones.</li>
<li>Quality can vary — melatonin is not tightly regulated in supplements.</li>
<li>May cause vivid dreams or grogginess in some people.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Melatonin can be helpful for people with delayed sleep phase disorder, frequent travel, or trouble falling asleep. It is generally not needed for most cases of obstructive sleep apnea, and it won’t treat airway obstruction.</p>

<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p>Melatonin may be a safe, short-term option for certain sleep issues. If you're considering it as part of your routine, it’s best to talk with your healthcare provider to ensure it fits your overall sleep treatment plan.</p>
