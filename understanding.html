      <h2>Types of Sleep-Disordered Breathing</h2>
      <p><strong>Primary Snoring:</strong> Noisy breathing during sleep caused by vibration of tissues in the throat (such as the soft palate or uvula). It <em>does not</em> involve pauses in breathing or drops in oxygen, but it may still disrupt sleep and indicate airflow restriction.</p>

      <p><strong>Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome (UARS):</strong> A condition where the airway narrows slightly during sleep, causing increased effort to breathe. Though oxygen levels typically remain stable, this leads to repeated arousals (micro-awakenings), resulting in <em>unrefreshing sleep and daytime fatigue</em>.</p>

      <p><strong>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA):</strong> A more serious condition where the airway becomes partially or completely blocked repeatedly during sleep. These episodes can last 10 seconds or longer, leading to <em>reduced oxygen levels</em>, poor sleep quality, and long-term health risks. OSA severity is measured by the <strong>Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)</strong> on a sleep study.</p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>Left untreated, sleep-disordered breathing can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Disrupt your body’s natural sleep cycles</li>
        <li>Lead to serious health issues such as:
          <ul>
            <li>High blood pressure</li>
            <li>Heart attack or heart failure</li>
            <li>Stroke</li>
            <li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
            <li>Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Increase your risk of drowsy driving or workplace accidents</li>
        <li>Decrease overall quality of life</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>The good news is</strong> that effective treatments exist. Identifying and treating SDB can lead to better sleep, more energy, improved mood, and long-term health benefits.</p>
