  <h1>Your Personalized Care Pathway</h1>
  <p>We believe in a thorough, individualized approach to help you achieve restful sleep and better health.</p>

<h2>What to Expect at Your Initial Visit</h2>
<p>At your first appointment, we will take time to thoroughly understand your symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle. This includes a comprehensive history and physical exam focused on your entire upper airway. Depending on your symptoms, we may perform a nasal endoscopy to assess your nasal passages and upper throat. We may also recommend a CT scan of your sinuses if sinus disease or nasal obstruction is suspected.</p>

<section>
<h2>Sleep Testing: Home vs. Lab-Based</h2>
<p>Most patients begin with a home sleep apnea test (HSAT), which is convenient, cost-effective, and sufficient for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea in many cases. However, an in-lab sleep study (polysomnography or PSG) may be recommended if results from the home study are inconclusive, if complex sleep disorders are suspected, or if additional brainwave or limb movement monitoring is needed.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Choosing a Treatment Plan</h2>
<p>We take a personalized approach to treatment. Your plan is based on factors including the severity of sleep apnea, anatomy, comorbid conditions, lifestyle, and your treatment preferences. We review all suitable options, from CPAP and oral appliances to surgery, Inspire therapy, and weight loss support. Our goal is to help you find a long-term solution that fits your needs and improves your quality of life.</p>
