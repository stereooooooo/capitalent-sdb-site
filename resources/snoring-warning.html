        <h1>When Snoring Is a Sign of Something More</h1>
    <p><strong>Snoring is common — but it’s not always harmless.</strong></p>
    
<p>Snoring happens when air flows past relaxed tissues in the throat, causing vibration. While it can be harmless in some people, loud and frequent snoring may be a warning sign of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).</p>

<h2>How to Tell the Difference</h2>
<div class="callout-box">
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary snoring:</strong> Smooth, steady snoring without major pauses or gasping</li>
<li><strong>Sleep apnea:</strong> Snoring interrupted by breathing pauses, gasping, or choking</li>
<li><strong>Partner observations:</strong> Often it’s the bed partner who notices signs of apnea</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<div class="callout-box">
<ul>
<li>Sleep apnea increases the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and daytime fatigue</li>
<li>Snoring alone can still disrupt your bed partner’s sleep and affect your relationship</li>
<li>Sleep studies can distinguish between primary snoring and apnea</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>If you snore regularly or wake up tired, don’t ignore it. It may be a simple noise — or a signal of something deeper that deserves attention.</p>
