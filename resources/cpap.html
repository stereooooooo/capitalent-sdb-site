        <h1>Tips for CPAP Success</h1>
    <p><strong>Strategies to help you adjust to and benefit from CPAP therapy.</strong></p>
    
<p>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy is the most effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but getting used to the machine takes time and support. Here are some tips to help you succeed with CPAP therapy.</p>

<h2>Getting Comfortable</h2>
<div class="callout-box">
<ul>
<li><strong>Start gradually:</strong> Wear your mask while watching TV or reading before bed.</li>
<li><strong>Try different mask styles:</strong> Nasal pillows, nasal masks, and full-face masks fit differently.</li>
<li><strong>Use a heated humidifier:</strong> Helps reduce dryness or congestion from airflow.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sticking With It</h2>

<ul>
<li>Keep your machine and mask clean to avoid irritation or infection.</li>
<li>Track your usage — many machines record sleep data that can be reviewed with your provider.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>CPAP works best when it's consistent. With support and the right setup, most people can adjust and feel much better — even after years of poor sleep.</p>
