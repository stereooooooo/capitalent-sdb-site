        <h1>What Happens During REM Sleep?</h1>
    <p><strong>Understanding one of the most important stages of your sleep cycle.</strong></p>
    
<p>REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement — a phase of sleep where your brain becomes more active and dreaming occurs. It’s also a time when your body temporarily loses muscle tone, which is important for people with sleep apnea to understand.</p>

<h2>Why REM Sleep Is Important</h2>
<div class="callout-box">
<ul>
<li><strong>Memory:</strong> Helps with learning and emotional regulation</li>
<li><strong>Dreaming:</strong> Most vivid dreams happen in REM</li>
<li><strong>Brain health:</strong> Thought to aid in mental clarity and cognitive function</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>What Makes REM Different?</h2>
<div class="callout-box">
<ul>
<li>Heart rate and breathing become less regular</li>
<li>Your brain is active but your muscles are paralyzed — which prevents you from acting out dreams</li>
<li>Sleep apnea is often <em>worse</em> during REM due to reduced airway muscle tone</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>REM sleep is essential for mental and physical health — and it's often disrupted in people with sleep apnea. Effective treatment can help restore a healthy sleep cycle and more consistent REM sleep.</p>
