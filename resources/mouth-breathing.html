        <h1>How Mouth Breathing Affects Sleep</h1>
    <p><strong>Why nasal breathing is healthier — and how to improve it.</strong></p>
    
<p>Mouth breathing during sleep is more common than many people realize. While breathing through your nose is optimal, some people rely on their mouth due to congestion, allergies, or habit — and that can affect your sleep.</p>

<h2>Why Nasal Breathing Is Better</h2>
<div class="callout-box">
<ul>
<li><strong>Filters and humidifies air:</strong> Your nose traps allergens and adds moisture to the air you breathe.</li>
<li><strong>Improves airflow pressure:</strong> Nasal breathing supports proper pressure in the upper airway.</li>
<li><strong>Promotes nitric oxide production:</strong> Which helps oxygen absorption and blood flow.</li>
</ul>
