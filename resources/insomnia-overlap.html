        <h1>Insomnia and Sleep Apnea</h1>
    <p><strong>When trouble falling asleep and trouble staying asleep overlap.</strong></p>
    
<p>Insomnia and sleep apnea are two of the most common sleep problems. Many people actually experience both at the same time. This is called COMISA — co-morbid insomnia and sleep apnea — and it can be tricky to manage.</p>

<h2>How They Interact</h2>
<div class="callout-box">
<ul>
<li>Sleep apnea can cause frequent awakenings that make it hard to stay asleep</li>
<li>Insomnia can cause stress and anxiety that make it hard to fall asleep</li>
<li>The combination leads to poor sleep quality and daytime fatigue</li>
</ul>
