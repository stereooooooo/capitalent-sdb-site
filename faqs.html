    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p>Your questions answered about sleep-disordered breathing, diagnosis, and treatment.</p>
  </section>

  <div class="container faq-section">
    <button class="accordion">What is sleep-disordered breathing (SDB)?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>SDB refers to a group of conditions — including snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) — in which breathing is disrupted during sleep. It can affect sleep quality and overall health.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What symptoms should I watch for?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Common signs include loud snoring, gasping or choking at night, waking unrefreshed, excessive daytime sleepiness, brain fog, irritability, and difficulty concentrating.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Do I really need a sleep study?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Yes, if you have symptoms of SDB. A sleep study helps determine the severity and type of sleep disorder so we can tailor treatment for you.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What is the difference between a home sleep test and in-lab study?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Home sleep tests are convenient and detect obstructive sleep apnea. In-lab studies provide more detailed data and are used for complex cases or when other sleep disorders are suspected.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What treatment options do you offer?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>We offer CPAP therapy, oral appliances, nasal and sinus procedures, throat surgery, Inspire therapy, weight management, and allergy care. Your treatment plan will be based on your anatomy, preferences, and sleep study results.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Can I treat sleep apnea without using a CPAP machine?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Yes. Options include oral appliances, Inspire therapy, positional therapy, weight loss, and surgical interventions. CPAP is first-line for many patients but not the only solution.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What if I tried CPAP and couldn’t tolerate it?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>You’re not alone — many patients struggle at first. We can help with mask fitting, humidification, and acclimation. If it still doesn’t work, we’ll discuss alternative treatments.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Will insurance cover my sleep evaluation and treatment?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Most insurance plans cover sleep studies and medically necessary treatments like CPAP. Coverage for oral appliances, Inspire, or surgery varies. We’ll help you understand your benefits.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How do I get started?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Call our office to schedule a consultation. We’ll review your symptoms, perform a thorough exam, and guide you through next steps — including sleep testing and treatment planning.</p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="accordion">How do I know if I'm a candidate for the Inspire Implant?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>The Inspire implant is appropriate for certain patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea who are unable to tolerate CPAP. You must have a body mass index (BMI) under a certain threshold and undergo a brief airway evaluation called Drug-Induced Sleep Endoscopy (DISE). Our team can help assess whether you’re a candidate based on your anatomy and sleep study results.</p>
    </div>
  
    <button class="accordion">What is the next step after a home sleep study is ordered?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Our office will get insurance approval. Our sleep study coordinator will then contact you to let you know when the device is either ready to be picked up from our office or mailed to you. You typically only need to use the home sleep study device for one night and then return it the next day. We will then either call you to notify you of your results and discuss next steps or will ask you to return to the office to discuss the results and treatment plan in person.</p>
