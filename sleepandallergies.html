    <h1>Sleep and Allergies</h1>
    <p>Understanding how allergies affect your sleep and what you can do about it.</p>

      <p>When you think of allergies, you might think of sneezing, itchy eyes, or a runny nose. But allergies can also affect how well you sleep. In fact, people with nasal allergies are more likely to experience poor sleep quality, trouble falling asleep, and waking up tired.</p>

      <h2>How Allergies Disrupt Sleep</h2>
      <p>Allergies cause swelling and congestion in your nose and sinuses, making it harder to breathe through your nose at night. You might snore more, wake up often, or even stop breathing briefly if you have sleep apnea.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Congestion can block your airway and reduce oxygen levels</li>
        <li>Postnasal drip can irritate your throat and cause coughing</li>
        <li>Allergy symptoms tend to get worse at night, especially during certain seasons</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
      <p>Here are a few ways to sleep better if allergies are getting in the way:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a daily nasal steroid spray (like Flonase or Nasonex)</li>
        <li>Keep windows closed during high pollen times</li>
        <li>Shower before bed to wash off allergens</li>
        <li>Use an air purifier and wash bedding weekly in hot water</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
      <p>If allergy treatments aren't helping your sleep, talk to your doctor. You might benefit from allergy testing, prescription medication, or even immunotherapy (allergy shots or drops).</p>

      <p><strong>Good sleep is possible — even with allergies.</strong> Managing your symptoms can help you breathe easier and wake up feeling more rested.</p>
